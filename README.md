The collection contains field notebooks, specimen ledgers, correspondences, and other documents relating to the Vertebrate Collections at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History. The serial field notes of pioneering Colorado naturalists Denis Gale and Edward Royale Warren richly document the fauna and ecology of early Colorado, describing specimens collected while on expeditions throughout the state through photos and detailed journal entries ranging from 1860-1940. The Vertebrate ledger series represents the original accounting system for the museum, capturing every specimen accessioned into the collection along with associated locality, morphometric and biological data. Letters and other documentation pertain to vertebrate specimen holdings and the long lineage of curators since the museumâ€™s inception in 1902. DOI: https://doi.org/10.25810/y3h1-1593
