# Background
This project is a partnership between the libraries and the Museum of Natural History on campus. Once we finish up the cataloging for these notebooks (birds, herps, osteo, and nest/egg), the pages are going to be individually uploaded so they’ll be visible in LUNA (libraries’ collections) and ARCTOS (museum’s specimen catalog) after a linking project is completed by Museum staff. The original, handwritten records are important for researchers to reference because of the contextual information that the formatting provides to the specimen records. All of the information contained in these entries for specimens still at the museum has (theoretically) been transcribed into controlled Darwin Core fields, but researchers still find it imperative to look at the handwritten records. The Scientific Name, Higher Classification, and the assorted identifiers provide critical access points for researchers searching for specific records or browsing the collection for assorted species and specimens. 

### From the museum:
The University of Colorado Biology Department Bird Catalog: no. 1-259 likely only matches GUIDs on legacy identifiers (often these are recorded  as "mus. no.") and #s 1-259 do not relate to GUIDs [backstory = these were a teaching collection in the Ramaley Building later incorporated into the Museum collection]. The University of Colorado Museum Bird Catalog: no. UCM 7-4049 should be a complete duplication and University of Colorado Museum Bird Catalog: no. UCM 7601-11099  a partial duplication of bird specimens originally recorded in the combined bird and mammal catalogs (University of Colorado Museum combined Bird and Mammal Catalog: no. UCM 1-3436, University of Colorado Museum combined Bird and Mammal Catalog: no. UCM 3437-5902, University of Colorado Museum combined Bird and Mammal Catalog: no. UCM 5903-8040). Because birds and mammals were combined, there are many number gaps (e.g., mammal GUIDs 1, 4, 5, bird GUIDS 2, 3, 6). Colorado College ledgers will likely have legacy identifiers (CCM#) that relate to GUIDs, or none at all, as they donated a bunch of taxidermy mounts that are not cataloged in the UCM collection.

## RelationLink
For items that have blank Scientific Name and Higher Classification columns, briefly check the link in this column - if it pops up an “item not found” page, replace the text with Not listed in ARCTOS
Items with a species name or classification already listed don’t need to be checked. These have been inserted using a data dump from ARCTOS, so we know they’re in there. 
## Scientific Name
Some of these have been filled in via lookups from the ARCTOS database. The existing scientific names do not need to be verified.
For blank items, please transcribe the Scientific Name from the original document, found in Q:\Cataloging\LUNA\Current_projects\NHIST_Vertebrate_Zoology_Documentation\Birds_zooLed_individual_jpegs
After transcribing the Scientific Name, please add the Higher Classification and the Higher Classification Source.
## Higher Classification
Navigate to https://www.gbif.org/species/search?q=
This takes you straight to the Species search.


Enter the name recorded in the Scientific Name column(s) on the spreadsheet into the search box. 
A small dropdown box may appear below the search box once you start entering text. At this point you can limit the search to Scientific names. This is sometimes helpful, but not always necessary. 

Try entering Asio flammeus



There’s a primary species, and a LOT of subspecies of these guys!
Because the primary species was recorded for this particular record, and not any of the subspecies, it’s necessary to just stick to the primary species record - Asio flammeus (Pontoppidan, 1763). Click on this record.

Higher Classification is formulated from the information on the side bar:
Kingdom | Phylum | Class | Order | Family
Genus and Species are part of the Scientific Name, so these aren’t included.
This is the same for specimens with subspecies listed as well. 

## Higher Classification Source
If sourced from GBIF, list GBIF. If sourced directly from ARCTOS or another resource, list ARCTOS or the other resource. 
If a Scientific Name doesn’t match any in any database and a Higher Classification can’t be listed, leave this blank.
